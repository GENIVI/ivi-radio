Description of test cases:

The simulated stations are configured in the subdirectory 'bin/config' in
single files.  The entries for FM and DAB stations are of course different.
Until a 'seek' with 'autostore' has been done, the simulator currently does
not know anything about the stations since the configuration files have not
been read. Hence when startTune or seek (with auto-up/-down) are used it will
not identify / find any station and will not be able to return any lists.

Following test cases are known to work:

Start myProvider and myClient 1:
In myClient application use in the following order:

seek - AMFM - SM_AUTOSTORE - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    After a short time, seek will start from beginning to end of valid
    frequencies of FM area. The seek progress will not be reported to the
    client (HMI) in regular intervals, since this has not been asked for
    through a controlUpdate request. However the end will be reported
    with SM_OFF.

controlUpdate - UE_SEEK - UT_NOTIFICATION - AMFM_FM - ST_UNDEF
    This will enable the progress report during a scan for AMFM_FM.

controlUpdate - UE_SEEK - UT_NOTIFICATION - DAB_DAB - ST_UNDEF
    This will enable the progress report during a scan for DAB.

seek - AMFM - SM_AUTOSTORE - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    same as above, but now the seek progress will be reported to the
    client (HMI) every 10%.

controlUpdate - UE_SEEK - UT_NONE - AMFM_FM - ST_UNDEF
    This will disable the progress report during a scan.

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - UNDEF_SOURCE - ST_UNDEF
    will return an empty list, since DAB seek has not been completed yet

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - AMFM_FM - ST_UNDEF
    will deliver a list of stations. From this point in time the stations
    are known to the client and can be used in a startTune request for
    tuning, as well as in a seek (auto-up/-down) request to find the
    next receivable station.

seek - DAB - SM_AUTOSTORE - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    Same as above for DAB frequency range

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - DAB_DAB - ST_UNDEF
    Same as above for DAB stations

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - UNDEF_SOURCE - ST_UNDEF
    will deliver a list with only FM entries, as DAB scan has not been
    performed yet.

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - AMFM_FM - ST_UNDEF
    will deliver a list of stations. From this point in time the stations
    are known to the client and can be used in a startTune request for
    tuning, as well as in a seek (auto-up/-down) request to find the
    next receivable station.

seek - DAB - SM_AUTOSTORE - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    Same as above for DAB frequency range

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - DAB_DAB - ST_UNDEF
    Same as above for DAB stations

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - UNDEF_SOURCE - ST_UNDEF
    Now that both seeks have been performed, it will deliver the
    combined list of stations with duplicates removed, i.e.
    a list of undef stations with just PI-Code / Service ID as ID and
    the common general name of the stations.
    Once this list has been received, it is now possible to startTune
    in SM_LIST mode with UNDEF_DEVICE

seek - anything except DAB or AMFM - any values ...
    Will fail as 'not applicable'

controlUpdate - anything - anything - anything except DAB_DAB / AMFM_FM or UNDEF_SOURCE - anything
    Will fail as 'not applicable'

startTune - anything except SM_DIRECT or SM_LIST - anything ...
    Will fail as 'not applicable'

startTune - anything - anything except AMFM or DAB - anything
    Will fail as 'not applicable'

startTune - SM_DIRECT - AMFM - 90500
    will tune to 90.5 Mhz, and deliver a currentStation info that at
    this frequency there is no receivable station.

startTune - SM_DIRECT - AMFM - 90400
    Will fail as 'not applicable' since this tuner is already tuned
    and tuning must be aborted first using abortTune API.

seek - AMFM - SM_AUTO_UP - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    will search upwards to next receivable station which is e.g.
    Bayern 1 at 91.3 Mhz. The progress will be reported if configured.
    The end of seek will be reported with SM_OFF, and the
    tuning will be reported by currentStation broadcast.

seek - AMFM - SM_AUTO_DOWN - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    will search backwards and find Bayern 3 at 90.0 Mhz,
    reports see above.

abortTune - AMFM
    will abort the tuning and free the tuner

abortTune - DAB
    Will fail as 'not applicable' since DAB tuner currently is not tuned

startTune - SM_LIST - AMFM
    will display the AMFM list retrieved from controlUpdate and let you
    choose one entry. The selected station will then be tuned to.

abortTune - AMFM
    will abort the tuning and free the tuner

startTune - SM_LIST - DAB
    will display the DAB list retrieved from controlUpdate and let you
    choose one entry. The selected station will then be tuned to.

abortTune - DAB
    will abort the tuning and free the tuner

startTune - SM_LIST - UNDEF_DEVICE
    will display the combined list retrieved from controlUpdate and let you
    choose one entry. One station matching the selected PIcode / Service id
    will then be tuned to.

abortTune - AMFM or DAB
    (depending on last choice) will abort the tuning and free the tuner

makePermanent - AMFM - select Station from list - TRUE
    permanent flag should be turned on

makePermanent - AMFM - select another Station from list - TRUE
    permanent flag should be turned on

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - AMFM_FM - ST_PERMANENT
    both stations should be returned

makePermanent - AMFM - select one previously selected station from list - FALSE
    permanent flag should be turned off for that station

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_ONCE - AMFM_FM - ST_PERMANENT
    remaining station of the former two should be returned

*** FRESH START REQUIRED ***

controlUpdate - UE_STATION_LIST - UT_NOTIFICATION -AMFM_FM - ST_UNDEF
    enables the station list update feature

seek - AMFM - SM_AUTOSTORE - Genre 0 - Flags 0
    should run a autostore seek and deliver a list of changed stations

startTune - SM_LIST - AMFM
    should allow to choose from stations just received

*** any change within station list and subsequent seek should deliver
*** new updates, with attribute CHANGED set and RECEIVABLE set when
*** station is either NEW or again receivable, or in case it is no
*** longer receivable, have the RECEIVABLE flag removed
